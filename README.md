Marpa
=======

Marpa is a Raku interface to the libmarpa C library.

Installation
============

* Marpa requires libmarpa to be present. I'd recommend installing from packages, or just look on the libmarpa website for install instructions.


* Using zef (a module management tool bundled with Rakudo Star):

```
    zef install Marpa
```

## Testing

To run tests:

```
    prove -e raku
```
